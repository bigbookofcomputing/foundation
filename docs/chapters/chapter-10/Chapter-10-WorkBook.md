## Chapter 10: Elliptic PDEs (e.g., Laplace's Equation)

### 10.1 Chapter Opener: The Physics of "Steady State"

> Summary: Elliptic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), such as **Laplace's Equation** ($\nabla^2 \phi = 0$), govern **static, steady-state fields** (electrostatics, heat flow) and are pure **Boundary Value Problems (BVPs)**, requiring a solution that models global equilibrium.

Our computational journey now extends to model **fields** in two or three dimensions. This chapter addresses systems that have reached **equilibrium**, meaning their properties are no longer changing with respect to time ($\frac{\partial}{\partial t} = 0$).

**Physical Examples of Static Fields**:
* **Electrostatics:** Finding the electric potential $\phi(x, y)$ between fixed voltage boundaries, governed by **Laplace's Equation**: $\nabla^2 \phi = 0$.
* **Heat Flow:** Determining the stable temperature $T(x, y)$ on a plate, governed by $\nabla^2 T = 0$.
* **Gravitation:** Finding the potential $\phi(x, y, z)$ created by a fixed mass distribution $\rho$, governed by **Poisson's Equation**: $\nabla^2 \phi = 4\pi G\rho$.

**The "Problem": Elliptic PDEs**
These problems are described by **Elliptic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)**, defined by the **Laplacian operator** ($\nabla^2$):
$$\nabla^2 \phi = \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial z^2} = f(x, y, z)$$

The "Elliptic" nature means the solution is a single, static **shape** determined entirely by the fixed conditions on the surrounding boundary (a pure BVP).

**The "Solution": Relaxation**
We extend the **Finite Difference Method (FDM)** from Chapter 9 into two dimensions. This converts the calculus problem into a large **system of linear equations** (algebra), which we solve using an iterative technique called **relaxation**.

### Comprehension & Conceptual Questions

#### Quiz Questions

* a) Hyperbolic PDEs.
* b) Parabolic PDEs.
* c) **Elliptic PDEs**. (**Correct**)
* d) Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs).

**2. Laplace's Equation, $\nabla^2 \phi = 0$, implies what physical condition at every point in a charge-free region?**

* a) The field must be zero.
* b) The field must be changing linearly in time.
* c) **The field is at equilibrium, with no net flux (or source) at that point**. (**Correct**)
* d) The field is propagating as a wave.

#### Interview-Style Question

**Question:** Give two distinct physical examples of static fields governed by Elliptic PDEs, and explain why the main difference between Elliptic and Parabolic PDEs is the presence of the time derivative.

**Answer Strategy:**
1.  **Examples:** Electrostatic Potential ($\nabla^2 \phi = 0$) and Steady-State Heat Flow ($\nabla^2 T = 0$).
2.  **Difference:** Elliptic PDEs model systems that have reached **equilibrium**; thus, the $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ term is zero. Parabolic PDEs (Chapter 11) model **dynamic diffusion** ($\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 T$), which is inherently time-dependent.

### Hands-On Project

**Project Idea: Modeling Steady-State Heat Flow (Thermal Contours)**

* **Task:** Set up a rectangular plate with four fixed, uneven boundary temperatures (e.g., Left $= 100^\circ\text{C}$, Right $= 50^\circ\text{C}$).
* **Goal:** Visualize the resulting temperature field $T(x, y)$ using a **heatmap** and overlay the **isothermal contour lines** (lines of equal temperature), demonstrating the final equilibrium shape.

## 📐 10.2 The 2D Laplacian: The "Five-Point Stencil"

> Summary: The 2D Laplacian is discretized by summing the Central Difference stencils for $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$ and $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}$. This yields the **Five-Point Stencil** rule: $\phi_{i, j} \approx \frac{1}{4} (\text{Average of 4 Neighbors})$.

**The Goal:** Find an algebraic approximation for the 2D Laplacian operator, $\nabla^2 \phi = \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial y^2}$.

**The Derivation (The FDM Stencil)**:
1.  Substitute the $O(h^2)$ **Central Difference stencil** (Chapter 5) into each dimension.
    $$\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{\phi_{i+1, j} - 2\phi_{i, j} + \phi_{i-1, j}}{h^2}$$
2.  Sum the two contributions and set the result to zero (for Laplace's Equation, $\nabla^2 \phi = 0$).
3.  Rearranging and solving for the central point $\phi_{i, j}$ yields the final rule:

$$\boxed{\phi_{i, j} \approx \frac{1}{4} \left( \phi_{i+1, j} + \phi_{i-1, j} + \phi_{i, j+1} + \phi_{i, j-1} \right)}$$

**The "Aha! Moment"**
This **Five-Point Stencil** is the entire algorithm. It means the potential at any interior point in an equilibrium field is simply the **average of the potentials of its four immediate neighbors**.

**Accuracy:** Because it uses the $O(h^2)$ Central Difference stencil, the approximation maintains **second-order accuracy** ($O(h^2)$).

### Comprehension & Conceptual Questions

#### Quiz Questions

**1. The final FDM algebraic rule for Laplace's Equation (the Five-Point Stencil) dictates that the potential $\phi_{i,j}$ is equal to:**

* a) The sum of its four nearest neighbors.
* b) **The average of the potentials of its four nearest neighbors.** (**Correct**)
* c) The first derivative in the $x$-direction.
* d) The potential from the previous iteration.

**2. What is the order of the **Truncation Error** for the FDM stencil used to solve Laplace's Equation?**

* a) $O(h)$.
* b) **$O(h^2)$**. (**Correct**)
* c) $O(h^4)$.
* d) $O(\epsilon_m/h)$.

#### Interview-Style Question

**Question:** Explain the physical meaning of the Five-Point Stencil rule ($\phi_{i, j} \approx \frac{1}{4} (\text{Average of 4 Neighbors})$). Why does this simple algebraic statement define "equilibrium" in a static field?

**Answer Strategy:** This rule defines **perfect equilibrium**. If the potential at the center $\phi_{i,j}$ were *not* the average of its surroundings, there would be a non-zero **second derivative** (curvature). In physical terms, this non-zero curvature indicates a source/sink or a net flux (heat flow or electrical current). Since Laplace's Equation ($\nabla^2 \phi = 0$) defines a charge-free, static state, the potential must perfectly average out the influences of its neighbors.

### Hands-On Project

**Project: FDM on a Simple Linear BVP (Validation)**

* **Task:** Write a function `phi_update(i, j, phi)` that applies the Five-Point Stencil rule to a central point $(i, j)$ using the surrounding grid values.
* **Goal:** This function is the single, non-iterative core of all the relaxation methods (Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, SOR) that will be implemented in the following sections.

## 🍮 10.3 The "Relaxation" Analogy

> Summary: The iterative solution process is called **relaxation** because it simulates a physical system (like a taut rubber sheet) settling from an initial guess into its final, stable equilibrium shape, defined by the Five-Point Stencil.

The iterative technique of solving Elliptic PDEs is called the **Relaxation Method** because it computationally models the physical system settling into equilibrium.

**The "Analogy": The Taut Rubber Sheet**
The process can be visualized as a **taut rubber sheet** (or trampoline) where the edges are **pinned** (fixed boundary conditions). The interior is given an initial guess (a perturbation) and then iteratively "relaxes" into its final, stable shape, which is the solution to Laplace's equation.

**The Iterative Process**:
1.  **Guess:** Start with an initial grid $\phi_{\text{old}}$.
2.  **Sweep:** Repeatedly loop across every interior grid point $(i, j)$ and update its value using the Five-Point Stencil.
3.  **Convergence:** The iterations stop when the maximum change in potential between successive full sweeps falls below a set **tolerance**, signifying **numerical equilibrium**.

## 🕰️ 10.4 Method 1: The Jacobi Method

> Summary: The **Jacobi Method** is the conceptually simplest relaxation method, requiring **two copies** of the grid to update all points **synchronously**, using only $\phi_{\text{old}}$ values. It is highly parallelizable but suffers from **slow convergence**.

The Jacobi Method calculates all new values based **only** on the values that existed **before the current iteration began** ($\phi_{\text{old}}$).

**The Algorithm:**
* **Memory:** Requires **two full copies** of the grid ($\phi_{\text{old}}$ and $\phi_{\text{new}}$).
* **Update:** $\phi_{\text{new}}[i, j]$ is calculated using the average of the four neighbors from $\phi_{\text{old}}[i\pm 1, j\pm 1]$.
* **Limitation:** **Slow Convergence**. Information from the boundary propagates inward by only **one grid unit per iteration**.

## 🧠 10.5 Method 2: The Gauss-Seidel Method

> Summary: The **Gauss-Seidel Method** utilizes only **one array** and updates points **sequentially**, using newly calculated values immediately. This accelerates information propagation and is typically **twice as fast** as Jacobi.

The **Gauss-Seidel Method** is an efficient improvement that utilizes the newest calculated potential values *immediately* within the current sweep.

**The Algorithm:**
* **Memory:** Requires only **one array** ($\phi$).
* **Update:** Updates are performed **sequentially**. When calculating $\phi_{i, j}$, the method uses $\phi_{\text{new}}$ values for the already-updated neighbors (e.g., $\phi_{i-1, j}$ and $\phi_{i, j-1}$) and $\phi_{\text{old}}$ values for the yet-to-be-updated neighbors ($\phi_{i+1, j}$ and $\phi_{i, j+1}$).
* **Advantage:** **Faster Convergence**. Information propagation is accelerated because the boundary influence travels inward faster. It is approximately **twice as fast** as the Jacobi method.

## 🚀 10.6 Method 3: Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR)

> Summary: **SOR** is the fastest iterative method, building on Gauss-Seidel by using an **over-relaxation factor** ($\omega$, where $1 < \omega < 2$) to intentionally **overshoot** the equilibrium value, dramatically accelerating convergence.

The **Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) Method** is a direct acceleration of Gauss-Seidel using **extrapolation**.

**The Algorithm:**
The SOR update applies the Gauss-Seidel correction multiplied by the over-relaxation factor $\omega$:
$$\phi[i, j] = \phi_{\text{old}}[i, j] + \mathbf{\omega} \cdot (\phi_{\text{GS}}[i, j] - \phi_{\text{old}}[i, j])$$

* **Over-Relaxation Factor ($\omega$):** The factor must satisfy **$1 < \omega < 2$**.
* **Tuning:** When $\omega$ is tuned correctly (often $\approx 1.8$ to $1.9$), SOR can reduce the total number of iterations by an **order of magnitude** compared to Gauss-Seidel.

### Comprehension & Conceptual Questions

#### Quiz Questions

**1. What is the primary characteristic of the **Jacobi Method**?**

* a) It is the fastest method.
* b) **All new values are calculated based *only* on the potentials from the previous iteration ($\phi_{\text{old}}$)**. (**Correct**)
* c) It uses an over-relaxation factor $\omega$.
* d) It is not parallelizable.

**2. The **Gauss-Seidel Method** improves upon the Jacobi Method by making what adjustment?**

* a) Using a larger grid spacing $h$.
* b) **Using newly calculated potential values immediately within the current sweep** (sequential update). (**Correct**)
* c) Switching to a spectral method.
* d) Requiring only one iteration.

**3. What is the purpose of the **over-relaxation factor $\omega$** in the **SOR Method**?**

* a) To decrease the total memory required.
* b) **To push the updated potential past its equilibrium value to accelerate dampening.** (**Correct**)
* c) To prevent the solution from exceeding the boundary conditions.
* d) It reduces memory usage by eliminating the need for a second array.

#### Interview-Style Question

**Question:** Explain why the **Gauss-Seidel Method** is typically more efficient for a single-processor (serial) implementation compared to the **Jacobi Method**.

**Answer Strategy:** The efficiency gain comes from **faster information propagation**. Gauss-Seidel updates the grid **in place** (one array) and uses the newest calculated values immediately within the current sweep, accelerating the transmission of boundary influence to the interior. Jacobi, requiring two arrays, forces a full wait until the end of the iteration, resulting in slower convergence.

### Hands-On Project

**Project: Convergence Rate Showdown (Jacobi vs. Gauss-Seidel)**

1.  **Formulation:** Set up a grid with fixed boundary conditions (Section 10.7).
2.  **Tasks:** Implement both the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel Methods.
3.  **Goal:** Create a **semilog plot** showing $\log_{10}(\text{Max Change})$ versus the $\text{Iteration Number}$ for both methods, visually proving that Gauss-Seidel requires fewer iterations to reach the same tolerance.

## ⚡ 10.7 Core Application: The Electrostatic Box

> Summary: The electrostatic box governed by Laplace's Equation is solved via the Gauss-Seidel Method, iteratively applying the Five-Point Stencil until the potential field stabilizes, yielding equipotential contour lines perpendicular to the field.

The **Electrostatic Box** is the classic application of FDM relaxation.

**The Physics:** We solve **Laplace's Equation** ($\nabla^2 \phi = 0$) for a square region where three walls are $0$ V and one source wall is $V_0$.

**The Strategy (Gauss-Seidel):** We iteratively sweep across the grid, updating all interior points based on the **Five-Point Stencil average rule** until the maximum change between iterations falls below a tolerance.

**Physical Interpretation**:
* **Heatmap:** Shows the final static potential distribution $\phi(x, y)$.
* **Contour Lines:** Trace the **equipotential lines** (paths of constant $\phi$). The hidden **electric field ($\mathbf{E}$) is always perpendicular** to these lines.

## ⏳ 10.8 Chapter Summary & Next Steps

**What We Built: A 2D Static Solver**
* **Operator:** Discretized the 2D Laplacian into the **Five-Point Stencil** ($O(h^2)$ accurate).
* **Methods:** Implemented iterative **relaxation** using Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and SOR.

**The "Big Picture": Sparse Matrix Solvers**
The relaxation methods are **iterative solvers** for the underlying sparse matrix system $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ that results from FDM.

**Bridge to Chapter 11: The Time Dimension**
We now re-introduce the time derivative ($\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}$) to solve the **Parabolic PDE** (Heat/Diffusion Equation):
$$\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 T$$
This requires coupling FDM stencils with time-marching, forcing us to immediately confront **CFL stability constraints**.
