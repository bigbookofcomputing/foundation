# Welcome to *Foundation of Computation*

Computing has become one of the most essential tools of modern science. Whether you are modeling planetary motion, analyzing experimental data, solving differential equations, or exploring high-dimensional signals, **computation is now inseparable from doing real physics and applied mathematics**.

This book is designed to guide you through the core ideas, numerical methods, and computational strategies that working scientists rely on every day. It is not merely a collection of algorithms—it is a *framework* for understanding how computers think, how numbers behave inside machines, and how reliable computational results are produced.
